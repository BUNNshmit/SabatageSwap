# SabatageSwap  
DeathSwap from Dream's videos, except it's free, and **works with more than 2 players**.  
Fully functional and simple lobby system.

# Concept
Every 3 to 5.5 minutes, every player on the sever gets their location swapped with another player at random. PvP is permanently disabled, so the only way to kill other players is to build traps.

# Lobby System
The first time a player joins the server, they'll be given a red wool, which they can right click to indicate that they're ready. Once every player on the server is ready, if there is at least 2 players, the game will start. There will be a 5 minute grace period before the first swap. Every swap afterwards is randomly set between 3 to 5.5 minutes.

# Commands/Permissions
**/swap**: Manually swaps players. (*Permission: ss.swap*)
